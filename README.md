# Blog Engine 2025
It is a new year.  Are you even a hacker if you aren't making another pointless blog engine?

I've thought of which stupid name I was going to give to Blog Engine 2025.  I started off calling it the Half-Butt Blog Engine, but, to fit in the 2025 vibe, I'm going to call it...

**BroChat**

## New Year, New Stupidity

I never made much progress on Blog Engine 2024. The theme for Blog Engine 2024 was to learn to be cloud native.  I learned a lot about cloud native: I learned that it is expensive.

For Blog Engine 2025, I'm going to focus on usability.  I want to be able to instantly post a quick text or photo. 
1. I want it to be as easy to post on my own blog as it is to Twitter or Instagram.
   a. I should be able to take a pic from my phone straight into a blog post, like Instagram.
   b. I should be able to choose a pic already saved on my phone's gallery, preview it, and make a post.
   c. I should be able to make a plain text microblog (tweet-like) post on a very simple form which is just a text box and submit button
2. I want to finally get some decent security: SSL, a proper login scheme
3. Prefer server-side to javascript.
4. Create the ability to stream my personal music collection to me alone.  To stream my own music collection just to me seems legal as fair use, as far as I can tell.
5. Create some websockets app to practice that technology. Perhaps a chat room?

## Gopher and BBS
I always have this notion that it would be cool to allow my content to be visible as Gopher or BBS.  Maybe I'll get to that, too.

## Tech
LNSP stack:
- Linux
- nginx
- SQLite
- PHP

## Objective goals and Extra Credit
Most importantly, I want this to be usable from my phone. On my old blogs, I never posted ephemeral content because they were mostly set up to create long-form content. I want it to be as easy to send my nonsense photos and tweets to my own site as it is to the social media sites.

I want a private streaming channel of my punk rock music archive, if I can figure out how to do it without getting flagged or accidentally making it public in a way that violates copyright law.

And, for extra credit, I'd like to create BBS and Gopher front-ends so that the content can be seen via other protocol.
