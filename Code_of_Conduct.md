# Bro Code of Epic Conduct

## Our Bro Oath
We, the bros, contributors, and alpha leaders of this crew, swear to make our squad a no-drama, fist-bump-worthy zone for every bro, no matter their age, gains, hidden or visible battle scars, heritage, manliness, experience level, gym cred, bank account, nationality, style, creed, or who they’re vibing with.  
We vow to keep it real, act like true bros, and build a legendary, jacked, inclusive, and straight-up awesome brotherhood.
## Bro Standards
Here’s how bros keep the vibe epic:  
- Showing mad respect and hyping up other bros.  
- Staying chill with different takes, styles, and stories.  
- Dropping and taking constructive bro-tips like champs.  
- Owning screw-ups, throwing out a “my bad, bro,” and leveling up from it.  
- Thinking about what’s best for the whole crew, not just your own gains.

Un-bro behavior that gets you sidelined:  
- Throwing around locker room talk or NSFW vibes.  
- Trolling, roasting too hard, or starting beef.  
- Creeping on bros publicly or privately.  
- Leaking a bro’s private deets, like their gym address or DMs, without their go-ahead.  
- Any move that’d make you look like a total tool in the bro circle.

## Bro Enforcement Duties
Our head bros are tasked with keeping the crew tight and enforcing these rules. They’ll step in with fair, no-nonsense action if any bro’s acting shady, toxic, or straight-up un-bro.  
Head bros can yeet comments, commits, code, or any contributions that don’t vibe with this Bro Code and will drop a line explaining why when needed.

## Scope of the Bro Code
This code rules all bro spaces—online, offline, in the group chat, or at the tailgate. It also applies when you’re repping the crew with an official email, social media flex, or acting as the squad’s ambassador at events.

## Calling Out Un-Bro Moves
If a bro’s acting out of line, hit up the head bros. All reports get checked out fast and fair.  
Head bros keep it 100, respecting the privacy and safety of anyone who drops a report.

## Bro Justice Guidelines
Head bros will use these Bro Impact Guidelines to handle violations of the Bro Code:  
- Bro Correction
  Vibe Check Fail: Dropping weak language or acting like a rookie in the crew.
  Consequence: A private “yo, tighten up” message from the head bros, laying out why the move was weak. Might need to throw out a public “my bad” to the squad.  

- Bro Warning
  Vibe Check Fail: One-off or repeated un-bro behavior.
  Consequence: A warning with a “chill or else” clause. No contact with the bros involved, including sliding into their DMs or socials, for a set time. Messing this up could mean a temp or permanent benching.  

- Temp Bench
  Vibe Check Fail: Majorly harshing the crew’s vibe, like ongoing un-bro antics.
  Consequence: Temporary exile from all crew hangs or chats for a set time. No sliding into DMs or bothering the head bros enforcing this. Break the rules, and you’re risking a permanent boot.  

- Permanent Boot
  Vibe Check Fail: Straight-up toxic pattern, like harassing a bro or throwing shade at entire squads.
  Consequence: Lifetime ban from all crew action, public or private. You’re out, bro.

Keep it bro-tastic, stay jacked, and let’s make this crew legendary!
